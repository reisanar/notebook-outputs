    "## Classification Problems (Supervised Learning)\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification in machine learning is the process of predicting _discrete class labels_ for input data based on patterns learned from a labeled dataset. It involves training a model using examples where the correct categories are known, allowing the model to learn the relationship between input features and output classes. Once trained, the model can assign new, unseen data points to one of the predefined categories. The primary goal is to develop a model that accurately generalizes to new data, effectively **distinguishing between different classes** based on learned patterns."

    "### Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is a statistical method used for binary classification tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea is to _model the probability that a given input point belongs to a particular class_. This is achieved by applying the logistic function, e.g., the sigmoid function, to a linear combination of input features. The logistic function compresses any real-valued number into a value between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as a probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm estimates the parameters (weights) that best fit the data by _maximizing the likelihood_ of observing the given sample set. This is often done using optimization techniques like gradient descent. Once trained, the model computes the probability of the input belonging to a class, and a threshold (commonly 0.5) is used to make the final classification decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it works well for linearly separable data, its performance may decline with more complex patterns unless combined with feature engineering or transformed into non-linear forms."

    "## Example: the Donner Party\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1846, the Donner and Reed families left Springfield, Illinois, for California by covered wagon. In July, the [Donner Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donner_Party), as it became known, reached Fort Bridger, Wyoming. There its leaders decided to attempt a new and untested route to the Sacramento Valley. Having reached its full size of 87 people and 20 wagons, the party was delayed by a difficult crossing of the Wasatch Range and again in the crossing of the desert west of the Great Salt Lake. The group became stranded in the eastern Sierra Nevada mountains when the region was hit by heavy snows in late October. By the time the last survivor was rescued on April 21 1847, 40 of the 87 members had died from famine and exposure to extreme cold."
